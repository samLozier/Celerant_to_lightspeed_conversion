# Celerant to lightspeed - Product data conversion script in Python 

This is a script for extracting product data from Celerant database and reformatting for upload to a Lightspeed Database. If you don't want to interact directly with the DB from Python , you can just run the same SQL query directly and save the file as a .csv 

I have no plans to update this after I'm done using it, but it took a while to setup and might save another business some hassle. This assmes you're running Celerant Point of Sale and are switching to Lightspeed Retail. 

Obviously, check your work and use at your own risk.
