# Celerant_to_lightspeed_conversion
Script for extracting product data from Celerant database and reformatting for upload to a Lightspeed Database

I have no plans to update this after I'm done using it, but it took a while to setup and might save another business some hassle. This assmes you're running Celerant Point of Sale and are switching to Lightspeed Retail.
